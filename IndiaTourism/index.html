                            Iconic Gateway of India is a must-see when in Mumbai. Built to commemorate the arrival if
                            King George V and his wife Queen Mary in 1911, this stunning piece of architecture was
                            opened with much pomp and ceremony in 1924 and was, for a while, the tallest structure in
                            the city.

                            Constructed entirely of yellow basalt and concrete and notable for its Indo-Saracenic
                            design, the Gateway of India was also the scene of a rather less jubilant procession of
                            British soldiers in 1948 when India gained its independence. These days, the huge archway
                            provides a stunning backdrop that is as popular among locals as it is tourists.

                            by Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu monks, and make for an excellent excursion from Mumbai, some
                            300 kilometers to the west.
                            <br><br>
                            Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this remarkable collection of 34 carved monasteries,
                            chapels, and temples – 12 of them Buddhist, 17 Hindu, and five belonging to the Jain faith –
                            were built in close proximity to each other, a reflection of the religious tolerance that
                            existed during this period of Indian history.
                            <br><br>
                            Of the Buddhist monastery caves, highlights include a number of shrines featuring carvings
                            of Buddha and saints dating from the 5th to 7th centuries, as well as the stunning
                            Carpenter's Cave, considered one of the finest in India.

                            The Hindu caves are much more complex and were carved from the top down, so scaffolding was
                            not necessary. Of these, the best is the Kailasa Temple, an enormous rock-cut temple
                            representing Mount Kailasa and requiring the removal of 200,000 tons of rock.

                        <div id="info1">Dominating the old city of Jodhpur, the massive Mehrangarh Fort, one of the
                            largest fortifications in India, was built in the 15th century to safeguard the people of
                            the famous "Blue City." Jodhpur is still known by this name, which is derived from its
                            indigo-colored houses, painted blue to deflect the heat.
                            <br><br>
                            Built on top of a towering outcrop, Mehrangarh is an amazing feat of construction, its
                            massive walls all but impenetrable. Access is via one of seven splendid gates, including
                            Jaya Pol and Fateh Pol (the latter still bears scars from cannon attacks).
                            <br><br>
                            Highlights of a visit include exploring the fort's fascinating network of courtyards and
                            palaces, as well as a museum housing a splendid collection of artifacts related to the
                            Maharajas. Be sure to spend time in the historic center of Jodhpur itself, famous for its
                            eight city gates, a lovely old clock tower, and numerous bazaars selling everything from
                            vegetables to sweets, spices, and handicrafts.

                            India's most revered natural wonders. It's also one of the country's leading attractions,
                            drawing crowds of Indian nationals to partake in its religious ceremonies, as well as
                            tourists to enjoy the splendor of this mighty river.
                            <br><br>
                            While there are a number of cities dotted along the river, it's to the city of Varanasi that
                            most tourists will travel to experience the Ganges and the cultural attractions that have
                            sprung up along its banks. Although relatively small by Indian standards – its population is
                            around 1.2 million people – the city is chock-full of temples and other important religious
                            sites, many of them focused on worship of (or on) the Ganges.
                            <br><br>
                            Numerous "ghats" are set along the river banks, making it easy for worshippers and tourists
                            alike to get up close. Made up of sometimes steep steps leading directly into the water,
                            there are in fact 88 of these entry points to the Ganges. While most are many centuries old,
                            they were extensively reconstructed and improved in the 1700s, and with their often vibrant,
                            colorful ceremonies and celebrations are some of the most beautiful places to photograph in
                            India.
                            <br><br>
                            If you've time, opt for one of the Ganges river tours available in the city from any one of
                            the ghats. The most memorable are the early morning sunrise cruises. Top the experience by
                            purchasing one of the small, floating offerings available from a vendor and set it off down
                            the river (camera at the ready, of course).

                        <div id="info1">The sprawling city of Mysore is a delight to explore thanks to its eclectic mix
                            of fine old colonial architecture; regal Indian palaces; and lush, well-manicured gardens.
                            While those inclined towards shopping will enjoy spending time in the city's famous silk and
                            sandalwood bazaars, the main attraction is magnificent Mysore Palace.
                            <br><br>
                            Completely rebuilt in 1897 after a devastating fire, this beautiful three-storied palace
                            features highlights such as its elegant square towers and domes; the many ornate ceilings
                            and pillars in Durbar Hall; and the splendid Marriage Pavilion, with its glazed floor tiles,
                            stunning stained glass, artworks, and displays of jewelry. It's also where, on special
                            occasions, the exquisite Golden Throne is exhibited.
                            <br><br>
                            For a real treat, be sure to catch one of the splendid light displays held each Sunday and
                            during holidays, when the palace is illuminated by more than 90,000 lights. A fun way to
                            explore the palace's massive grounds and gardens is as part of a cycle tour, available free
                            once inside.

                        <div id="info1">Bodhgaya, considered the world's holiest Buddhist site, attracts thousands of
                            visitors each year, all drawn to participate with the resident monks in meditation and
                            prayer.
                            <br><br>
                            The focal point of this place of pilgrimage is stunning Mahabodhi Temple, built next to the
                            very spot where Buddha came to Enlightenment and formulated his philosophy on life.
                            Constructed in the 6th century and restored numerous times since, the temple is topped with
                            a beautiful pyramidal spire and houses a large gilded statue of Buddha.
                            <br><br>
                            Also of interest is the site's pipal tree, a descendant of the original bodhi tree where
                            Buddha meditated for seven days after the Enlightenment, said to be among the oldest and
                            most venerated trees in the world (you'll know you've found it when you spot the red
                            sandstone slab marking the spot).
